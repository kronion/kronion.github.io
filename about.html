      <h1>Motivation for this course</h1>
      <p>
        The worldwide web is an incredible ecosystem of people and technology. It connects us as never before and offers rich experiences ranging from gaming to Google search and social media to streaming music. The ability to create content for the web is the power to reach millions of people and build The Next Big Thing. However, it can be difficult to learn how to begin. This class aims to flatten the learning curve. Over the course of four weeks, I will teach you how to make your first web application. You will learn to construct pages using HTML and CSS, give them functionality through the language of Javascript, and finally build a "backend" to serve pages and save to a database.

      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Collin Stedman, and I am a junior engineering student in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. I wrote my first line of code in February of 2012, and I took this very class last Fall. I wanted to teach this class because I believe that that my experience learning to program as an adult in college may give me some insight into your needs as students. I also want you to know that I’ll be learning with you. I would like to mold this class to fit the needs and learning styles of its participants (more on that in a minute), and that means I may experiment with the class structure during the first few weeks. If you have any feedback or preferences regarding my teaching style, please let me know.
      </p>

        It should also go without saying that I’m as prone to error as anyone else. If you catch a mistake in my notes or lectures, please let me know! You will improve the class for everyone, and you might teach me something as well.
