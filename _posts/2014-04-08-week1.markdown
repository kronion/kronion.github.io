Many people have been asking me to write a handout defining the tools that we will use in this class, as well as how to download and set them up.

I finally found the time to make such a handout, which you can access [here][pdf]. In the handout, I make recommendations for editors, browsers, and terminals to use on both OSX and Windows. I assume that you already know what you're doing if you are a Linux user, but the OSX instructions all still apply to Linux save for those about terminals.

Note that I don't cover the installation of Node.js and related tools, which we will use in the second half of this class. We will cover the installation of Node in the third lecture.
