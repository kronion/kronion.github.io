Hello, and welcome to the web development track of Princeton Hack Classes, presented by Princeton's Entrepreneurship Club. In this first lecture, we will learn about how to create static pages for the web using HTML and CSS.

You can find the lecture slides [here][slides]. To supplement the slides, I have written a handout which contains most of my talking points and several code examples. You can find that [here][handout]. Any code examples I add in the future will be found here, so be sure to check back.
